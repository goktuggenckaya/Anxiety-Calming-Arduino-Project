# Anxiety Calming Arduino Project
 Developed an electronic device that is capable of playing calming music during an anxiety attack by measuring the pulse of the user. Dealt with circuitry, Arduino code, soldering, 3D design on Fusion360 after Selçuk Artut’s Physical Computing course.

 Most of the anxiety and panic attack patients had night-terrors or midnight panic attack from time to time. It is considered as the worst attack since what triggered the anxious mood is completely uncertain and prevent the attack is challenging because of that. During an anxiety attack, people should get low amounts of stimulus possible. It is essential to understand that attacks disrupt the rational thinking and prevent the patient from being
mindful about what to do during an attack.
 Considering this complaint of panic attack and anxiety disorder patients, I wanted to design a home gadget that will stay in bedside all the time during sleep. During a panic
attack, when the patient wakes up with anxiety, they can reach to this device and it senses the heartbeat and pulse of the patient. If the pulse is too high according to average night-time heartbeat of a normal healthy individuals, then it starts a song that is proven to be good for anxiety patients. Sometimes, patient may feel anxious but body won’t be reacting as much as the mind does. In this situation, device doesn't plays the music. It is designed to play the music only when the psychological circumstances start to affect the physical health of the individual.
